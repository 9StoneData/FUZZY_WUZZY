Also, it is my intention to monetize this data and build out a dashboard SaSS.  I need to store it in database, and I want to have clean tables.  \n",

And now, its gone.  Play montouge....  I am back, lets do this again.  Now lets try weighting the searchers, load the names with aditional information... No, lets try building a parsrer with a library I never even used before.  Two days later, I discoverd gold in them there hills.  Cascadeing parser.  Cleans the names and captures key data.  Ok, I am about to get Mr. \"Humpty Data\" off the wall.  \n",

I reduced the names down to similar names, but now I had grouped them too well.  Turns out you need the weights and ratios in the name... Who knew.
